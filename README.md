Video Reviews (deprecated)
=================

Ziggeo API (http://ziggeo.com) allows you to integrate video recording and playback with only
two lines of code in your site, service or app. 

This is a simple video reviews application that we did for Sears Hackathon NYC. 



Setup
======

Copy config.default.js to config.js and replace all missing API keys with the correct ones. We
recommend running the application with Heroku, but really any NodeJS environment should do the
tricks.
